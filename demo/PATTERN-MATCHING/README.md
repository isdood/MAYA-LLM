### 001
1. Execute in terminal via ./001
2. Enter any combination of characters, and it will accurately identify 8 terms:
    - STARWEAVE
    - QUANTUM
    - HARMONIC
    - PATTERN
    - ZIG
    - CONCURRENT
    - PERFORMANCE
    - DEMO
    
NOTE: Capitalization is detected (ie. 'starweave' won't work, but 'STARWEAVE' will). Patterns detected within strings (ie. 1010101010ZIG101010110) would report back 1 instance of 'ZIG' succesfully.
