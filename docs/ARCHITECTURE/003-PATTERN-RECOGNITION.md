# MAYA Pattern Recognition System Architecture

## Overview

The MAYA Pattern Recognition System is a high-performance, memory-safe implementation of quantum pattern recognition using Zig. This document provides an in-depth look at the system's architecture, components, and their interactions.

## Core Components

### 1. Pattern (`pattern.zig`)
- **Purpose**: Fundamental data structure representing a pattern
- **Key Features**:
  - Binary data storage with metadata
  - Support for 7D harmonic coordinates
  - Memory-efficient serialization
  - Thread-safe operations

### 2. Pattern Storage (`pattern_storage.zig`)
- **Purpose**: Persistent storage for patterns
- **Features**:
  - Efficient pattern indexing
  - Similarity-based retrieval
  - Thread-safe operations
  - Memory-mapped I/O support

### 3. Pattern Cache (`pattern_cache.zig`)
- **Purpose**: High-speed in-memory pattern cache
- **Features**:
  - LRU eviction policy
  - Memory usage tracking
  - Thread-safe operations
  - Configurable size limits

### 4. Pattern Recognizer (`pattern_recognition.zig`)
- **Purpose**: Main interface for pattern operations
- **Features**:
  - Training interface
  - Recognition interface
  - Batch processing support
  - Integration with storage and cache

## Data Flow

### Training Flow
1. Client creates a new `Pattern`
2. `PatternRecognizer.trainSingle()` is called
3. Pattern is added to `PatternStorage`
4. A copy is cached in `PatternCache`
5. Success/failure is returned to client

### Recognition Flow
1. Client provides a pattern for recognition
2. `PatternRecognizer.recognizeSingle()` is called
3. Cache is checked first (fast path)
4. On cache miss, storage is queried
5. Best match is returned to client

## Memory Management

### Ownership Rules
1. **Pattern Creation**:
   ```zig
   const pattern = try Pattern.init(allocator, data);
   defer pattern.deinit();
   ```

2. **Pattern Duplication**:
   ```zig
   const copy = try pattern.dupe(allocator);
   defer copy.deinit();
   ```

3. **Cache Operations**:
   - `put()`: Takes ownership of pattern
   - `get()`: Returns a new copy that must be freed
   - `clear()`: Frees all cached patterns

### Thread Safety
- All public APIs are thread-safe
- Internal synchronization using mutexes
- Atomic reference counting for shared resources

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction
- Configurable cache size
- Memory usage monitoring

### Batch Processing
- Parallel pattern matching
- Memory-efficient batching
- Progress reporting

## Error Handling

### Error Types
- `error.OutOfMemory`: Allocation failures
- `error.InvalidPattern`: Malformed pattern data
- `error.StorageFull`: Storage capacity exceeded
- `error.CacheFull`: Cache capacity exceeded

### Recovery
- Automatic cleanup on error
- Transactional operations
- Graceful degradation

## Integration Points

### Internal
- Quantum state management
- Temporal pattern analysis
- Harmonic key system

### External
- Vulkan compute pipeline
- GPU acceleration
- Network interface for distributed processing

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Collected Metrics
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Memory usage
- Processing times

## Future Extensions

### Planned Features
1. **Versioned Serialization**
   - Backward compatibility
   - Schema evolution
   - Migration tools

2. **Advanced Caching**
   - Tiered storage
   - Predictive prefetching
   - Adaptive eviction policies

3. **Distributed Processing**
   - Sharding
   - Load balancing
   - Fault tolerance
